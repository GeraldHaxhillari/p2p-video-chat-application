# P2P Video Chat

It's a Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Video Chat Web application. People can go here and give access Audio/Video access to the web page, then type a room name and ask their partner to do the same, then finally chat with them!

The only catch is, you gotta type a unique room name and then share the name with your friend.

TODO: Change the UI/UX to tackle the problem of room name conflicts, by generating room names automatically. Something like the one in https://rollcall.audio or like https://appear.in.
